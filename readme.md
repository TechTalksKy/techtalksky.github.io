# Tech Talks Ky

This is the repo for the site at techtalks.ky

# ToDo
* build out admin panel
* once admin panel is built, add ui for Submissions.

## Submit a Talk

This was added so we could have a url we could send out in order to allow people to submit talks in a somewhat orderly fashion. This is quick and dirty. At this point is just collecting. We might need to build out an admin panel, that would allow us to view the submissions.

Once this is deployed the http://techtalks.ky/submit-a-talk url should be used to submit talks. Feel free to add fields if needed, but I added these:

* author_name
* email
* avatar (just a link to an image basically)
* description
* bio
* title
* body (a more in depth description of talk)
* availability (which month the person would like to present)
* city
