# Tech Talks Ky

This is the repo for the site at techtalks.ky

# ToDo
* sponsorship page.
* job board
    * this is a potential way to help offset costs

## Submit a Talk

This was added so we could have a url we could send out in order to allow people to submit talks in a somewhat orderly fashion. This is quick and dirty. At this point is just collecting. We might need to build out an admin panel, that would allow us to view the submissions.

Once this is deployed the http://techtalks.ky/submit-a-talk url should be used to submit talks. Feel free to add fields if needed, but I added these:

* author_name
* email
* avatar (just a link to an image basically)
* description
* bio
* title
* body (a more in depth description of talk)
* availability (which month the person would like to present)
* city

## Sponsorship

This meetup is great and we want to keep it growing and getting better. However, things cost money, like the rental of the room, meetup.com, hosting for the website. 

    * room rental $70/meeting
    * meetup.com $15/month
    * hosting $20/month
    * webcam/mic for recording

We are looking for sponsors to help with these costs. $100/month will get your company logo and link listed on the month you sponsor forever. We will also add it in the video that is put online. This meetup is also a great place for you to come talk about your company, or if you are looking for a job.

## Job Board

Everywhere needs to help find employees, we can charge a nominal fee to list, which directly goes to help support the meetup. (Which in itself is a great place to find employees). It's about the community we are trying to foster. Knowing more people in the local area that are devs or interested in learning. Talking amongst other people is the best way to learn.
